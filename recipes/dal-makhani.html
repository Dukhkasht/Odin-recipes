    <h2  class="sar">Description</h2>
    <p>Dal Makhani is a classic North Indian dish renowned for its rich, creamy texture and hearty flavor. It is made primarily from whole black lentils (urad dal) and kidney beans (rajma), simmered slowly with butter, cream, tomatoes, and a blend of aromatic spices. The lentils are typically soaked overnight and then cooked until tender, allowing them to absorb the flavors of the spices and creamy elements.</p>
    <p> The dish is finished with a garnish of fresh cream and often served with rice, naan bread, or roti. Dal Makhani is cherished for its comforting taste and is a staple in Indian restaurants and homes alike, offering a satisfying and wholesome meal option.</p>
